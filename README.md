I take a look at and compare Denver, CO with Louisville, KY for obesity rates in children ages 10-17. 
Denver has some of the lowest obesity rates compared to Louisville which has the highest obesity rate.
Compare the locations of schools in relation to fast food and parks to determine the differences in both cities.
